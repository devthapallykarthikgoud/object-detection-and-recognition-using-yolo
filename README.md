Object Detection and Recognition with Audio Output using YOLO Algorithm
This project is an AI-powered real-time object and face detection system that uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for high-accuracy detection, combined with face recognition and audio output. It can detect multiple objects and recognize known individuals from a live camera feed, then provide voice-based alerts or greetings in multiple languages.

Features
🎯 Real-Time Object Detection

Uses YOLOv8 for fast and accurate object detection.

🧑‍🦰 Face Recognition

Identifies known individuals and differentiates them from unknown persons.

🗣 Voice Output

Personalized greetings for known faces (e.g., “Hi, <name>”).

Optional generic alerts for unknown persons.

Supports Telugu and English voice output.

📹 Camera Input Options

Works with laptop camera or mobile IP camera stream.

🎨 Advanced User Interface

Modern Tkinter desktop UI and Flask web version.

Dark mode and multilingual support.

Live saved entries with names and contact info.

💾 Data Management

Save and manage captured faces/objects with details directly from the UI.
